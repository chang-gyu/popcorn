POPCORN HACKING GUIDE - KEXEC                                14th December 2012
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

kexec-2.0-popcorn-generic.patch
---------------------------------------
This patch adds to kexec two multikernel command line options to boot the
kernels. The boot address (-a) and the boot cpu id (-b).
Note that this is different from the 32bit version that loads a new kernel in
the boot time reserved crash kernel memory area.
The file kexec/kexec-elf-exec.c should be fixed to support kernel images bigger
then 20MB. The loading routine simply copy the kernel image to the specified 
physical address using the /dev/mem file. Again this should be fixed in a 
further version in order to avoid the usage of /dev/mem and improve security.

kexec-2.0-popcorn-syscall.patch
---------------------------------------
The patch contains the code to call the special multikernel syscall to boot a
kernel (that must be previously loaded in to physical memory).
Note that such syscall can be eliminated in order to reduce syscall pollution.
Kernel must support the syscall in order to work, the syscall number is
architecture dependent in the Linux kernel source code.

Notes
---------------------------------------
These patches are necessary to load and boot a new kernel in a Linux
multi kernel instance environment. We provide a modified version of the kernel
that must be used along this patch and a set of tools that complete the kexec
software. Please checkout our Linux kernel version before continue with the 
installation.
We also provide a series of scripts to automatically load the kernels, their 
ramdisks and boot parameters. Please checkout our tools repository.
